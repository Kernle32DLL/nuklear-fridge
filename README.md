# nuklear-fridge

__Warning: This library is work in progress! Not all nuklear elements are migrated yet, and the documentation is non existent. Use at own caution!__

nuklear-fridge is a small wrapper library around [golang-ui/nuklear](https://github.com/golang-ui/nuklear) with the aim to ease usage of the library.

The main feature of nuklear-fridge is the ability to assemble a so called _fridge_ - a collcetive description of multiple nuklear windows and their contents.

See the examples folder for some inspiration. The desktop example is taken directly from [golang-ui/nuklear](https://github.com/golang-ui/nuklear) and adapted to a _fridge_.

## Name

The name is a reference to the [fridge scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn4Vhkmb4Lw) of the otherwise medicore Indiana Jones 4.
